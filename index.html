                    GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that helps you write code faster and with less effort, allowing you to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration.

                    GitHub Copilot has been proven to increase developer productivity and accelerate the pace of software development. 
                </p></li><br>

                <li><p>
                    GitHub Copilot is a code completion and automatic programming tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI that assists users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs) by autocompleting code.
                </p></li><br>

                <li><p>
                Currently available by subscription to individual developers and to businesses, the generative artificial intelligence software was first announced by GitHub on 29 June 2021, and works best for users coding in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go. In March 2023 GitHub announced plans for "Copilot X", which will incorporate a chatbot based on GPT-4, as well as support for voice commands, into Copilot.

                    <h3>Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot</h3><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Focus on Logic: Use Copilot for boilerplate code and repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on more complex logic.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Stay in Control: Regularly review suggestions to ensure they align with your coding standards.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Security Checks: Be cautious of potential security implications of AI-generated code.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Linters and Formatters: Use Copilot alongside code linters and formatters to maintain code quality.</p></li><br>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Limitations of GitHub Copilot</h3><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Limited Context Understanding: Copilotâ€™s suggestions are based on code patterns and may not fully understand your specific application context.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Code Quality: Suggestions can sometimes be incorrect or non-optimal, requiring careful review and adjustments.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Avoid Sensitive Data: Do not use Copilot to generate code involving sensitive or proprietary information.</p></li><br>
                        <li><p>Over-reliance: Be mindful not to over-rely on Copilot; it is a tool meant to assist rather than replace thoughtful coding practices.</p></li><br>

                <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts, essays, code and emails.</p>

                <h4>Who created ChatGPT &quest;</h4><br>
                <p>OpenAI -- an artificial intelligence research company -- created ChatGPT and launched the tool in November 2022. It was founded by a group of entrepreneurs and researchers including Elon Musk and Sam Altman in 2015. OpenAI is backed by several investors, with Microsoft being the most notable. OpenAI also created Dall-E, an AI text-to-art generator.</p>

                <h4>How does ChatGPT work &quest;</h4><br>
                <p>ChatGPT works through its Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which uses specialized algorithms to find patterns within data sequences. ChatGPT originally used the GPT-3 large language model, a neural network machine learning model and the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The transformer pulls from a significant amount of data to formulate a response.</p>
